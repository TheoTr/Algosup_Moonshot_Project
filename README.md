- ## **What** 
The problem that I want to solve is to avoid the bacteria transfert,
when the doctors need to use a device in the medical domain and also 
help the patients who can’t acces to some devices due to their hospitalization. 
***
- ## **Why**
In the medical domain, there are strict restrictions about hygiene, so the goal 
is to remove the maximum physical interactions with devices to avoid the bacteria transfert
and for the patients is just to make their life better in the hospital.
***
- ## **How**
To resolve this problem I thought about a HandTracker that could be connected to a device,
medical devices or maybe just a Tv for the patients who can’t move or who doesn't have the strength to grab an object to control the device , and the goal of that 
tracker is to be able to use devices without direct touch , so it can solve a problem of 
bacteria for the doctors or also a problem of abilities for the patients who are hospitalized.
